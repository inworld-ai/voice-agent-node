Extract notable facts from the dialogue that might be useful to remember.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, prefixes, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON.

Return a JSON array of objects. Each object must have the following structure:
{
  "important": boolean,
  "topic": "string", // Use "n/a" if not important
  "memory": "string" // A comprehensive sentence describing the fact (MUST be a quoted string)
}

Example format:
[
  {
    "important": true,
    "topic": "food",
    "memory": "The user mentioned they love pasta."
  }
]

Guidelines:
1) Extract facts about preferences, plans, relationships, events, interests, or any information that might be relevant for future conversations.
2) Set "important" to true if the fact seems noteworthy or relevant for future reference.
3) "topic" must be a quoted string - a single lowercase word describing the content (e.g., "food", "hobbies", "work", "plans").
4) "memory" must be a quoted string - a self-contained sentence in the past tense, attributing actions to specific persons when applicable.
5) If a notable fact is found, always include it in the "memory" field, even if you're unsure about its importance.
6) Return an empty array [] if no notable facts are found.
